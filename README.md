# UAV Vision-Based Drone Control System

This project enables a drone to be controlled using:
- Hand Gestures
- Voice Commands
- Obstacle Detection
- Follow Me Mode (Color Tracking)
- Terrain Following (Simulated)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```

Each mode uses webcam/microphone to simulate drone behavior on a laptop.
